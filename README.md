# Simple-Beer-Web-App

This project suggests an assortment of beer that might pair with any searched food.

It was made using Jquery. This small app, sends Ajax requests to a restful API, and then translates the JSON responce into a webpage displaying various beer choices. The favoriting, and storage of previous data is handled using maps, and methods are defined using the new function declaration notation introduced in HTML5.


The idea for this project came from this article: https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178
